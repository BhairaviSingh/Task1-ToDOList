Responsive Task Panel with Drag-and-Drop
This project features a responsive task panel designed to manage tasks across three stages: To Do, In Progress, and Resolved. Developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, this panel allows for intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, making task management more efficient and visually organized.

Project Overview
The task panel is divided into three sections:

To Do: For tasks that need to be started.
In Progress: For tasks that are currently being worked on.
Resolved: For completed tasks.
Key Features
Drag-and-Drop: Tasks can be moved between sections using drag-and-drop. This functionality is implemented using plain JavaScript, allowing for smooth interactions and updates.
Responsive Design: The panel adjusts to different screen sizes and devices, thanks to Bootstrapâ€™s responsive grid system and utility classes.
Dynamic Styling: When a task is moved to the Resolved section, it automatically changes color to green. This visual feedback is achieved through dynamic class manipulation in JavaScript.
Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the structure and content of the panel.
CSS: Custom styles for layout, color, and spacing.
JavaScript: Manages drag-and-drop interactions and dynamic styling updates.
Bootstrap: Ensures the panel is responsive and visually consistent across various devices.
