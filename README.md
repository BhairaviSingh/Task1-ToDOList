# Responsive Task Panel with Drag-and-Drop

## Project Overview

This project features a responsive task panel designed to manage tasks across three distinct stages: **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Resolved**. Developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, this panel provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for task management, enhancing both usability and visual organization.

## Key Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Functionality**: Move tasks between sections using drag-and-drop. This feature is implemented with plain JavaScript for smooth interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to various screen sizes and devices using Bootstrapâ€™s responsive grid system and utilities.
- **Dynamic Styling**: Tasks automatically change color to green when moved to the **Resolved** section, offering clear visual feedback on task completion. This is managed through dynamic class updates in JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structures the layout and content of the panel.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for visual appearance, including colors and spacing.
- **JavaScript**: Handles drag-and-drop interactions and dynamic styling changes.
- **Bootstrap**: Ensures responsive design and consistent styling across devices.
